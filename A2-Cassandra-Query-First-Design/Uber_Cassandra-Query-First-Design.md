# UBER : Cassandra Query First Design

## Introduction
In this group project team is analysing the Uber cusomter application and all the relational data models for a passenger to book a ride. The first objective here is to build the Physical Relational Data model based on the sample ER diagram obtained from the public domain. Team also put together the applicaiton requirements considering application function and Query first design. Using those Queries team has designed the Data base with a NoSQL Database- Cassandra. 
In the next sections of this document detailed step by step processes and steps  followed are explained.

## RDBMS Schema Analysis
The below ER diagrams(figure1.1) show the high level design for the Uber passenger ride app, using which the Relationational modeling with the tables and the columns are built and presented in Relational Modelling section (figure 1.2).

## Query Analysis

#### Transaction Processing Queries

- Q1: (Passenger checking for Uber) Get all the available cars ( fare and arrival time) for the current location with a given radius grouped by car type with lowest arrival time.

- Q2: (System checking for available cars) get all the cars of a given type within radius of the given location.

- Q3: (System compute dynamic fare) : base fare + compute demand ( ratio of passenger waiting for car / number of available around a given location ).

- Q4: (Drive checking passenger details before accepting ) Get passenger details with given passenger id.

- Q5: (Passenger checking Driver information) get driver details with given driver id.

- Q6: Compute the surge fare.

#### Analytical Queries

- Q7 (Compute Passenger rating) get all the past trips for a given Passenger
- Q8 (Compute Driver rating) get all the past trips for a given Driver
  (Drive view, trip history ): get all the trips for a given Driver for a given day
- Q9 (Drive view, revenue): get total sum of revenue of given day
  (Company view, revenue): get total sum of revenue of given day, time slot, area

- Q11: How many trips has a passenger made within a certain time period?
- Q12: What is the average rating of a driver based on completed trips?
- Q13: What types of payment methods does a passenger use most frequently?
- Q14: Which cars (make and model) are most used by a particular driver?
- Q15: What is the average fare and tip size for trips of a particular ride type?
- Q16: How many rides have a driver canceled over the last year, and what were the penalties?
- Q17: For which rides did passengers leave rating, and what were those rating?
- Q18: What is the total fare generated by a particular car (identified by VIN) over its lifetime of service? --
- Q19: Can we list all drivers who have not driven in the past month?
- Q20: What are the most common pickup locations across all trips?

## Cassandra Schema Design

Sample Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;
```
